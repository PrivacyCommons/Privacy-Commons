# How we share

## Base share

- People you share and communicate with.

    When you share and communicate using our Services, you choose the audience who can see what you share. For example, when you post on Facebook, you select the audience for the post, such as a customized group of individuals, all of your Friends, or members of a Group. Likewise, when you use Messenger, you also choose the people you send photos to or message. 

    when you share a post (e.g., an update, video or blog), the default (which you can change) is to share it publicly. Others who are not your connections will be able to find (including through search engines) and see your post.
When you like, comment on or share another’s post, others will see it, including the person who initiated the post.

    In a group, posts are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile unless you change the default settings.

    Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by it and others who visit those pages.

- People that see content others share about you.

    Other people may use our Services to share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people may share a photo of you, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you that you shared with them. If you have concerns with someone’s post, social reporting is a way for people to quickly and easily ask for help from someone they trust. Learn More.


- Apps, websites and third-party integrations on or using our Services.

    When you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Services, they may receive information about what you post or share. In addition, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your Public Profile, which includes your username or user ID, your age range and country/language, your list of friends, as well as any information that you share with them. Information collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies.

## Extra share

### Include Advanced share

- Sharing With Third-Party Partners and Customers

    We work with third party companies who help us provide and improve our Services or who use advertising or related products.

- Advertising, Measurement and Analytics Services

    We do not share information that personally identifies you (personally identifiable information is information like name or email address that can by itself be used to contact you or identifies who you are) with advertising, measurement or analytics partners unless you give us permission. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying demographic information (such as 25 year old female, in Madrid, who likes software engineering) to these partners to help them understand their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by our advertiser guidelines.
